        I only got into reading about 5 years ago, although I prefer book series so I don't tend to read a lot.<br> Also as I tend to read mostly Japanese/Korean (light Novels) books I have to wait for them to be translated and then released. So it takes roughly 4 months before a new issue is released, even if the series has 20 books already written and published in Japan. <br> <br> Even as a child I had books read to me by my grandad every night I stayed over, I still have fond memories of him doing all the voices. <br> He used to read the famous five, the secret seven and harry potter to me and they are still some of my fondest books. <br><br> Whilst these are some of my favourites, I have many more that fill my bookshelf, this is just a few that came to mind first.

    <div>
        <p class="p3">
        In the year 2126, a Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game or DMMO-RPG called YGGDRASIL was released.<br> It stands out among all other DMMORPG's due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. After an intense 12-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. <br> Within the game exist a Guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game. <br> Of those four only one actually continues to play; his name is Momonga and he remains the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters, the Great Tomb of Nazarick. He invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. Though Momonga is saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their real lives to take care of. And so, he stays in the guild alone until the servers shut down.
        <br>
        Upon waking up, Momonga realizes that the game may not have shut down properly as he is still in his avatar form and he cannot seem to use the normal player function, such as Message, or even quit. <br> Then when the NPC's of Ainz Ooal Gown starts talking to him, he decides to take things seriously and find out if anyone from World of 2138 is also in this New World with him. <br> Taking on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown for the sake of his guild, Ainz wanted to send a message to any other players out there facing the same circumstance as he have. Henceforth, he begins exploring the world that is supposedly different from YGGDRASIL. <br> He tries to figure out what has happened while trying to find anyone, or anything, that could help him solve this mystery.

        Overlord was one of the first light novels I started to read because of an anime but with 13 books in the series soon to be 14, there's many reasons why I keep on reading. <br> One of those reasons is how well written it is, I find that once I start hours just go by in a flash. Which is a sign of how engrossed I get in the story, the world and the characters. I love the way the author (Kugane Maruyama) writes not just the main character but also the side characters and side plots. He does an amazing job of integrating a lot of story lines and bringing them into the main plot.<br> 
        Another reason overlord makes it into my top list is because of the awesome world that has been built and imagined, as it is a fantasy light novel it obviously adds the fantsty tropes but he (Kugane Maruyama) manages to add so much more to it than just the typical dragons, magic and fantasy creatures. To add to that the illustrations done by so-bin add so much character and life to your imagination. <br>
        As I am also older I apricate the darker and more mature themes that are present throughout the series. They are put forward in a very tactile way without feeling forced or unneeded, which just helps build to the nitty grttiy world. As the main character is seen as a villain (not from our prospective but from the common people) I think it's needed to show the motivations and reasons the main characters and side characters do what they do. <br> 
        Overall I'm hesitant to say that this is one of the best light novels written (certainly one of the constantly better ones I've read), as it hasn't finished yet and that the author has been getting burnt-out writing the series. But I really hope it continues with the fantastic story and ends like it begun. <br> Overall score: 89/100

    <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
    <div>
        <p class="p3">
        10 years ago, after “the Gate” that connected the real world with the monster world opened, some of the ordinary, everyday people received the power to hunt monsters within the Gate. They are known as "Hunters". <br> However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the "World's Weakest". Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-leveled dungeons… at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! <br> In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!

        So far I'm really enjoying reading Solo Leveling, even though there has only been 3 books translated and released so far. If it keeps up with the quality of characters and story it will be one of my favourite all time series. <br> Much like overlord it has fantasy aspects but done in a very different way from normal, which in this over saturated genre is a breath of fresh air. <br> I'm really enjoying the quality and consistency of the main character and again like overlord I don't catch myself getting bored (or wishing to go back to the main character) when reading the about the side plots/characters. <br> But as it is still so new I just hope it can keep up with the quality and storytelling to bring it's fantastic world to life.
        <br> Overall score: 85/100

While a handful was fortunate enough to become royalty, nobles, and other kinds of influential people, one girl was not so lucky. <br> Being reborn as a spider monster of the weakest kind in a dungeon filled with vicious beasts, she is forced to experience extreme hardship. Even so, armed with nothing but her human knowledge and overwhelming positivity, she continues to press on and survive against creatures much stronger than herself.

        I've just finished reading book 13 of the series and I'm still enjoying it. Although I don't enjoy all the characters and find some of the side plots a drag the overall series is strong and enjoyable. I did feel that the last book felt a bit rushed and just kind of setting the stage for the next couple of books but as the upcoming plot looks to be the next (final) big arc I don't mind so much. <br> I don't often read female led protagonist as I don't think they are done as well most of the time (especially in the types of books I tend to read), but after I read the first book in this series I ordered the next 3 that were already released and read them within a couple of weeks. <br> I've really enjoyed the main character so far and you can tell that the author (Okina Baba) has a real connection with the MC more than the rest of the cast. Because the writing does fall in quality and enthusiasm when the other characters are front and centre.

        This is my most disappointing series on this list as I loved the first 8 or so books but I feel the character has lost it's way. They are no longer the MC that set themselves apart from the rest of the books out there. I still think it's wroth reading and keeping up to date with it. <br> But it has now been relegated to buying the digital version, which for me is a sign of it loosing it's touch, because every other series on this list I have all the physical books for. <br> I hold out hope for it to return to it's former glory but I'm running out of patience after 5 mediocre books

        I have mixed feelings about this series as I do enjoy reading it and continue to pre-order the books, I do get tired and start skim reading through parts of it. However during the meaty parts of the story I can continue reading it for hours without putting it down. <br> So whilst I enjoy the overall series I think it could be cut down/trimmed a bit to make it a more enjoyable read.
