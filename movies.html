        In my first year of collage I started noting every movie I watch, so far I'm over 400 in 8 years. Recently I've started scoring them out of 10 and writing a couple of lines of my thoughts for each. <br> So it's fair to say I love movies of all sorts, from high octane thrillers to romcoms, from documentaries to space operas. This is to say that these 5 are just some of my favourite movies. For my actual favourites I'd have to do a top 100. <br> <br> As for TV, I don't tend to watch as many series as I don't think they make as many good TV seasons as they do good movies. <br> But nevertheless there are some absolute brilliant shows out there to watch and these 5 are just some that I highly recommend. <br> <br> So remember this is just a short list of some of my favourites and by no means is a complete list of the only great TV shows out there.

        <p class="p4">
        I really enjoyed watching the 4 IP Man films and have watched some of them a few times now. Even though the films are based (loosely) around true events, I take it with a pinch of salt. As after reading up on the real IP Man you can tell they shinned a very very favourable light on him. <br> But this doesn't take away from the movies. <br> The music is perfectly done for the films, the action is fantastic throughout & the story is compelling and interesting. <br> It knew the story it was telling throughout the series and stuck to it. I have to say that the action scenes are what sets it apart and without it certainly wouldn't be as interesting.
        <br> Overall score: 80/100

        <p class="p4">
        As the adaptation of the books that my grandad read to me the movies will always hold a special place. But even without the fond memories they are good movies, with my favourite being the half blood prince. <br> I think the movies and especially the future stuff (fantastic beast and the cursed child) have major flaws. Also I'm not a huge fan of Harry himself as I think "the chosen one" is just a bit of a cop out and he doesn't actually do much. mostly leaving it to Hermione. <br> But even with all that I would have done differently I still think they are a great set of movies that will continue to be a source of enjoyment for myself and future generations to come.

        I love the MARVEL series, of course they can't all be great ('CAPTAIN MARVEL') but for the most part they are solid enjoyable movies. And when marvel do it right (like in doctor strange, thor ragnarok or spider-man: no way home) the movies are brilliant.

    <h4>Synopsis:</h4>
    <div>
        <p class="p3">
        It is the year 1250 B.C. during the late Bronze age. Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband, Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. <br> After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. <br> So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans. <br> But they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy. The whole movie shows their battle struggles and the foreshadowing of fate in this adaptation of Homer's classic "The Iliad."

        <p class="p4">
        Troy has one of my favourite fight scenes in all movie history. Just 1 vs 1, not cut up into 1000's of different camera shots or cut scenes, great choreography and great stakes for the characters themselves.</p>

        </a>
        <br>
        <p class="p4">
        Even though that might be the highlight of the movie the rest is still very well done, and you can almost feel like you are there part of the armies. <br> I enjoy the romance between Achilles and Briseis. I really don't like Paris but he's the only character I don't like. <br> The overall story, characters, choreography is brilliantly well done.

        Not counting the last Jedi or rise of skywalker, the star wars movies are some of my personal favourite movies. More for nostalgia as some of my first movies and ones that I watched all the time as a child. <br> unfortunately the last 2 main series movies were dreadful with nothing but a couple (1 or 2) good characters, great high budget cinematography and a good score. Compare that to what it was like when the first trilogy and they just can't compete. <br> Even looking at the side movies, Solo: A Star Wars Story was pretty bad and full of problems. <br> I'm just glad that they are doing great TV shows at the moment and hope they can keep it up.

        Nine noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive.

Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order of business to investigate further. <br> Meanwhile, Queen Cersei Lannister's family may be hatching a plot to take power. <br> Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. <br> The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, Tyrell, and Martell leads to full-scale war. <br> All while an ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.

        <p class="p4">
        Season 1, 3 & 4 are some of best series of TV ever made so far and will be very hard to beat. I don't think there is a TV show as iconic as GOT, especially not one that has permeated social culture as much. You can go up to people and say "Winter is coming" or "You know nothing, Jon Snow" and people that haven't seen the show will still get the reference. <br> Season 3 Ep 9, is one of the best episodes of tv to have ever been made, period. <br> Did it go down hill? Yes, unfortunately but that doesn't take away from the rest of the series espically the early seasons. Just don't mention season 8.

    <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>

    <div>
        <p class="p4">
        I love crime dramas, so my series of choice to represent them here is Silent Witness. With 24 seasons so far there's a era for everyone. My favourite cast so far has been David Caves (Jack Hodgson), Emilia Fox (Nikki Alexandra), Liz Carr (Clarissa), Richard Lintern (Thomas). <br> I have watched every episode out so far with season 16-24 being my favourites. <br> I know Silent Witness is very consistent and that every 2 part episodes will be great. Of course I have other crime dramas that could have taken this spot, such as Vera, Endeavor or Midsomer Murders. But I think for how long it's been airing and how consistently good the episodes are, Silent Witness deserves the mention here.

    <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>

    <div>
        <p class="p4">
        Episode 3 is a fantastic episode and a great conclusion to the mini series. David Tennant is on top form throughout the episodes and really brings his character to life. <br> The rest of the characters are all fantastic and well preformed. I also love the shift in genres that goes throughout the 3 episodes, starting of as a law drama to horror aspects and then back to a legal proceeding. <br> Because of the short length and it being extremely well acted I'd recommend anyone watch it.

    <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>

    <div>
        <p class="p4">
        Unlike anything else I've seen or watched. With every episode being different with a different cast and theme, there is something for everyone. <br> Some episodes I'm not a huge fan of how they are filmed or what they feature. But as a whole the series is fascinating, wonderful and thought-provoking. <br> There is so much going on throughout the series and even more that is hidden away, forcing you to look deeper to understand the type of world that isn't that far away from our own.

    </div>
    <h4>My Thoughts:</h4>

    <div>
        <p class="p4">
        A fantastic first 3 seasons, with a quick decline in quality after season 3. It's very hard to describe what misfits is or isn't. But it just feels so human and real. <br> The plot allows each character their time to shine in one episode or more, and yet the main storyline progresses at a steady pace throughout.
