        Hello World!
        <br>
        <br>  My name is Benjamin Nebreda (24), my favourite past times are gaming, reading, watching movies/tv, cooking and tinkering with tech. <br>  I wanted to join this course because I've always had a vested interest in tech and how it works. Although I've tried self study courses before I know I work better in a classroom environment, so I knew that I had to take this opportunity when it came along. <br> <br> I have enjoyed every aspect of it so far and if given the opportunity would love to join the 12 week course when it comes around.  I feel that I have a strong grasp of basics of python, html and css. So I look forward to learning more about it and moving on to more languages. <br> <br>  So far my favourite project has been building games to test what I have learnt. At the beginning of the course I could already read and diagnose code (java) because I've made/ran 3 websites so far for my own businesses using wix, squarespace and shopify. But I never would have guessed how much I would have learnt and progressed in these 3 short weeks.<br> <br> I would love to be able to design, make and publish my own games. And I feel like that could become a part of my future because of this course and how much I have learnt from it. <br>
        Obviously, I'll need more experience and knowledge before I can make a full game ready for distribution but I feel like I'm on a good path for it. For now, I enjoy messing around on python and seeing what I can do and what roadblocks I encounter, then learning/researching how to overcome them.
